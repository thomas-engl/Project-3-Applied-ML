# Project-3-Applied-ML

Members: Lars Bosch, Philipp Brückelt and Thomas Engl

This project contains a self written code based on pytorch for a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve partial differential equations. We analyze its performance on the one and two dimensional heat equation and compare it to the finite element method (FEM).

The used packages can be found in the requirements.txt file and can get installed through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

# Structure:

Code/heat.py: Object oriented implementation of a neural network which can solve the d- dimensional heat equation
